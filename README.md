# Travel_Planer
The Travel Planner uses NLP to recommend destinations based on user preferences. It cleans and analyzes text, extracts key keywords using RAKE, understands meanings with WordNet, and detects sentiment using VADER. It then matches keywords and feelings with a destination database to suggest the best travel options.
